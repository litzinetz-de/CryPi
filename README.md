# CryptoPi

=== CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT - NOT READY FOR USE YET - CONTRIBUTIONS ARE WELCOME! ===

CryptoPi (CryPi) is a web based application written in PHP that helps you to manage OpenVPN connections to secure your internet connection.

You're able to import OpenVPN connection packets which are stored in truecrypt containers (v 7.1a, or course). With one click, the VPN tunnel is going up and the system starts acting as a NAT router. Configure your devices to use the CryPi system as default gateway and it will forward all your internet traffic trough the VPN tunnel.

This system is meant to secure your internet connection from spying. It's designed to be run on a raspberry pi using Raspbian OS.
